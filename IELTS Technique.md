### Quick Summary of Writing

- 2 sentences for intruduction (5 minutes, about 30 ~ 40 words)
  - Introduce the topic
  - Give a general answer
  - we need 4 types of question:
    - Discussion【讨论】
    - opinion
    - problem and solution
    - Two-part question
- 5 sentences for overview (10 minutes)
  - Idea
  - Explain (2 or 3 sentences)
    - Linking words do not help your 'vocabulary' score
    - Examiners want to see 'topic vocabulary'
  - Example
- 5 sentences for third detail paragraphs (10 minutes)
- 1 sentence for the conclusion (5 minutes)
  - **paraphrase** the answer that you gave in your **introduction**
  - summarise the problem and steps

```
short introduction and conclusion
and good main body paragraph in the middle

write 250 words in essay
```



```
as opposed to 与...相对
```

#### Great Example

On the other hand, the **opportunity** to do **voluntary community service** could be extremely positive for high school students. By making these **programmes optional**, schools would **ensure that only motivated students took part**. These young people would **gain valuable experience** in an **adult working environment**, which could help to **build their self confidence** and **enhance their skills**. Having such experience and skills on their CVs could greatly improve **school leavers' career prospects**. For example, a period of voluntary work experience might **impress a university admissions officer or a future employer**
